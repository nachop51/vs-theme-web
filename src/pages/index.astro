      "I tried the Nachop theme first and loved it! It made coding feel super comfortable, and I liked the color balance. After using it for a while, I wanted to customize it even more to fit my own style, so I tried the npm package, the process of creating my own theme was smooth. Really perfect for anyone who wants to personalize their workspace.",
